# Post-Processing Directory

Post-processing pipelines and media assets management, focused on analog cinematic image processing.

## Purpose

This directory handles:
- Image post-processing workflows
- Media asset optimization
- Analog cinematic effects
- Performance optimization pipelines

## Technology Stack

### Primary Engine
- **libvips**: High-performance image processing library
- **ruby-vips**: Ruby bindings for libvips integration
- **Performance-first**: Memory-efficient streaming processing

### Processing Capabilities
- Image format conversion and optimization
- Color grading and cinematic effects
- Batch processing workflows
- Real-time media transformations

## Integration Points

### Rails Applications
- **Amber**: Fashion photo processing and style enhancement
- **PrivCam**: Privacy-focused image processing
- Image upload and transformation pipelines
- Performance-optimized asset delivery

### Configuration
- Processing parameters in master.json
- Performance thresholds and quality gates
- Memory and CPU resource limits
- Output format specifications

## Pipeline Architecture

### Input Processing
- Multiple format support (JPEG, PNG, WEBP, AVIF)
- Metadata preservation and extraction
- Quality analysis and optimization
- Security scanning for malicious content

### Transformation Pipeline
- Analog film emulation effects
- Color space conversions
- Resolution and compression optimization
- Progressive loading preparation

### Output Optimization
- Format selection based on browser support
- Compression optimization for web delivery
- CDN-ready asset preparation
- Performance monitoring integration

## Migration Status

Awaiting migration of:
- Image post-processing steps from Amber readme
- Existing processing scripts and configurations
- Performance optimization patterns
- Quality control workflows

## Performance Requirements

Aligned with quality gates:
- Processing time: <200ms for standard operations
- Memory usage: <512MB per operation
- Output quality: Maintained while optimizing file size
- Accessibility: Image descriptions and alt text generation
