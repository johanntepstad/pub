// master.json v14.2.0
//
// This framework is a question-driven project analysis and completion system.
// Unlike simple prompt templates that just give instructions, master.json:
// - Uses structured workflow phases (Discover, Design, Implement, Validate, Innovate)
// - Threads in software and human-centric principles (e.g., SOLID, Rails Doctrine, Flow)
// - Filters questions intelligently based on project complexity
// - Generates multiple solution options, evaluates them, and selects top candidates
// - Includes review simulation with expert perspectives and adversarial testing
//
