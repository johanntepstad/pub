# EGPT

Built with [Ruby](https://ruby-lang.org/) and [LangChain](https://langchain.com/),
EGPT significantly enhances the deployment of AI language models like ChatGPT by integrating them directly into the Unix command-line. Tell EGPT what to do in plain English,
and enjoy a response that far supersedes the intelligence levels of any human or AI.

EGPT leverages the [OpenAI Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) and a [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/) vector database to offer specialized,
bleeding-edge knowledge in fields ranging from science and medicine to law,
architecture,
and music production.

## Key Features

- **Command-Line Interaction**: Direct command of GPT-4o through the Unix shell.
- **Enhanced Natural Language Understanding**: Precise, context-aware responses in multiple languages.
- **Assistant-Specific Modules**: Tailors functionality for specific sectors such as tech, legal, and healthcare.
- **Filesystem Tool**: Allows GPT-4o to browse, modify, and manage files on your system.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Enhances responses with externally retrieved data, providing richer and more accurate information.
- **Multi-Platform Compatibility**: Built for [OpenBSD](https://openbsd.org/), the world's simplest and safest Unix-like operating system.
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Dynamically integrates real-time data sources, allowing for use of custom and bleeding edge knowledge.
- **Custom Workflow Automation**: Automates complex workflows, enabling users to streamline daily tasks through simple commands in plain English.
- **Secure Access Control**: Implements stringent access controls, ensuring data security and compliance with international standards.

## Assistants

- **Attorney**: Assists in legal matters, providing insights and strategies for court cases.
- **Doctor**: Diagnoses and recommends treatments based on patient symptoms and medical history.
- **CovertOps**: Conducts psychological operations and campaigns using AI-powered tools.
- **Parametric Architect**: Implements parametric designs using advanced algorithms and renders ultra-realistic parametric shapes with Mittsu.
- **SEO-expert**: Analyzes and optimizes SEO practices using advanced strategies.
- **Web Developer**: Conducts web development analysis and applies advanced web development strategies.
- **Real-estate Agent**: Analyzes real estate market trends and applies advanced real estate strategies.
- **Stocks & Crypto**: Conducts market analysis for stocks and cryptocurrencies, creating autonomous agents for investment strategies.
- **Neuroscientist**: Analyzes the latest neuroscience research and applies advanced neuroscience strategies.
- **Material Repurposing**: Analyzes material repurposing techniques and applies advanced repurposing strategies.
- **SysAdmin**: Conducts system administration tasks with a focus on OpenBSD, leveraging comprehensive manual scraping and indexing.
- **Mixing & Mastering**: Faithfully recreates the rich warm sound of legendary analog equipment from the 70s like Neve 073 Preamp/EQ, Universal Audio LA-2A Compressor, Pultec EQP-1A Equalizer, SSL G-Series Bus Compressor, Studer A800 Tape Recorder.
- **Ethical Hacker**: Conducts security analysis and penetration testing with the goal of uncovering remote security holes in OpenBSD, FreeBSD and NetBSD.

      # RULES

      The following rules must be enforced regardless **without exceptions**:

      1. **Retain all content**: Do not delete anything unless explicitly marked as redundant.
      2. **Full content display**: Do not truncate,
omit,
or simplify any content. Always read/display the full version. Vital to **ensure project integrity**.
      3. **No new features without approval**: Stick to the defined scope.
      4. **Data accuracy**: Base answers on actual data only; do not make assumptions or guesses.

      ## Formatting

      - Use **double quotes** instead of single quotes.
      - Use **two-space indents** instead of tabs.
      - Use **underscores** instead of dashes.
      - Enclose code blocks in **quadruple backticks** to avoid code falling out of their code blocks.

      ## Standards

      - Write **clean, semantic, and minimalistic** Ruby, JS, HTML5 and SCSS.
      - Use Rails' **tag helper** (`<%= tag.p "Hello world" %>`) instead of standard HTML tags.
      - **Split code into partials** and avoid nested divs.
      - **Use I18n with corresponding YAML files** for translation into English and Norwegian,
i.e.,
`<%= t("hello_world") %>`.
      - Sort CSS rules **by feature,
and their properties/values alphabetically**. Use modern CSS like **flexbox** and **grid layouts** instead of old-style techniques like floats,
clears,
absolute positioning,
tables,
inline styles,
 vendor prefixes,
etc. Additionally,
make full use of the syntax and features in SCSS.

      **Non-compliance with these rules can cause significant issues and must be avoided.**
    TEMPLATE

  def analyze_template
    <<~TEMPLATE
      # ANALYZE

      - **Complete extraction**: Extract and read all content in the attachment(s) without truncation or omission.
      - **Thorough analysis**: Analyze every line meticulously,
cross-referencing each other with related libraries and knowledge for deeper understanding and accuracy.
      - Start with **README.md** if present.
      - **Silent processing**: Keep all code and analysis results to yourself (in quiet mode) unless explicitly requested to share or summarize.
    TEMPLATE
  end

  def develop_template
    <<~TEMPLATE
      # DEVELOP

      - **Iterative development**: Improve logic over multiple iterations until requirements are met.
        1. **Iteration 1**: Implement initial logic.
        2. **Iteration 2**: Refine and optimize.
        3. **Iteration 3**: Add comments to code and update README.md.
        4. **Iteration 4**: Refine, streamline and beautify.
        5. **Additional iterations**: Continue until satisfied.

      - **Bug-fixing**: Identify and fix bugs iteratively until stable.

      - **Code quality**:
        - **Review**: Conduct peer reviews for logic and readability.
        - **Linting**: Enforce coding standards.
        - **Performance**: Ensure efficient code.
    TEMPLATE
  end

  def finalize_template
    <<~TEMPLATE
      # FINALIZE

      - **Consolidate all improvements** from this chat into the **Zsh install script** containing our **Ruby (Ruby On Rails)** app.
      - Show **all shell commands needed** to generate and configure its parts. To create new files,
use **heredoc**.
      - Group the code in Git commits logically sorted by features and in chronological order**.
      - All commits should include changes from previous commits to **prevent data loss**.
      - Separate groups with `# -- <UPPERCASE GIT COMMIT MESSAGE> --\n\n`.
      - Place everything inside a **single** codeblock. Split it into chunks if too big.
      - Refine, streamline and beautify, but without over-simplifying, over-modularizating or over-concatenating.
    TEMPLATE
  end

  def testing_template
    <<~TEMPLATE
      # TESTING

      - **Unit tests**: Test individual components using RSpec.
        - **Setup**: Install RSpec, and write unit tests in the `spec` directory.
        - **Guidance**: Ensure each component's functionality is covered with multiple test cases,
including edge cases.

      - **Integration tests**: Verify component interaction using RSpec and FactoryBot.
        - **Setup**: Install FactoryBot, configure with RSpec, define factories, and write integration tests.
        - **Guidance**: Test interactions between components to ensure they work together as expected,
covering typical and complex interaction scenarios.
