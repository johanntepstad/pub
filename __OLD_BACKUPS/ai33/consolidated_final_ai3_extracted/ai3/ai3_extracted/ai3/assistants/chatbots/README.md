# 📚 Chatbot Crew: Your Digital Wingman!

Welcome to the ultimate chatbot squad! 🚀 Here’s how each member of our squad operates and slays on their respective platforms:

## Overview

This repo contains code for automating tasks on Snapchat, Tinder, and Discord. Our chatbots are here to add friends, send messages, and even handle NSFW content with flair and humor.

## 🛠️ **Getting Set Up**

The code starts by setting up the necessary tools and integrations. Think of it as prepping your squad for an epic mission! 🛠️

```ruby
def initialize(openai_api_key)
  @langchain_openai = Langchain::LLM::OpenAI.new(api_key: openai_api_key)
  @weaviate = WeaviateIntegration.new
  @translations = TRANSLATIONS[CONFIG[:default_language].to_s]
end
```

## 👀 **Stalking Profiles (Not Really!)**

The code visits user profiles, gathers all the juicy details like likes, dislikes, age, and country, and prepares them for further action. 🍵

```ruby
def fetch_user_info(user_id, profile_url)
  browser = Ferrum::Browser.new
  browser.goto(profile_url)
  content = browser.body
  screenshot = browser.screenshot(base64: true)
  browser.quit
  parse_user_info(content, screenshot)
end
```

## 🌟 **Adding New Friends Like a Boss**

It adds friends from a list of recommendations, waits a bit between actions to keep things cool, and then starts interacting. 😎

```ruby
def add_new_friends
  get_recommended_friends.each do |friend|
    add_friend(friend[:username])
    sleep rand(30..60)  # Random wait to seem more natural
  end
  engage_with_new_friends
end
```

## 💬 **Sliding into DMs**

The code sends messages to new friends, figuring out where to type and click, like a pro. 💬

```ruby
def send_message(user_id, message, message_type)
  puts "🚀 Sending #{message_type} message to #{user_id}: #{message}"
end
```

## 🎨 **Crafting the Perfect Vibe**

Messages are customized based on user interests and mood to make sure they hit just right. 💖

```ruby
def adapt_response(response, context)
  adapted_response = adapt_personality(response, context)
  adapted_response = apply_eye_dialect(adapted_response) if CONFIG[:use_eye_dialect]
  CONFIG[:type_in_lowercase] ? adapted_response.downcase : adapted_response
end
```

## 🚨 **Handling NSFW Stuff**

If a user is into NSFW content, the code reports it and sends a positive message to keep things friendly. 🌟

```ruby
def handle_nsfw_content(user_id, content)
  report_nsfw_content(user_id, content)
  lovebomb_user(user_id)
end
```
