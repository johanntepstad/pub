## Psychological Model Integration

AI^3 goes beyond simple command execution; it’s designed to interact in a human-like, adaptive, and supportive way through the integration of key psychological models:

1. **Personality Tailoring**: AI^3 adjusts its interaction style based on the Big Five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism), making conversations more personalized and effective.

2. **Needs-Based Interaction**: Following Maslow’s Hierarchy, AI^3 responds to user needs appropriately, whether offering basic information or supporting more complex, personal goals.

3. **Contextual Communication**: Using principles from Transactional Analysis, AI^3 adapts its communication style (Parent, Adult, Child) to fit the situation, ensuring interactions are contextually appropriate.

4. **Cognitive Support**: Incorporating Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), AI^3 helps users manage their thoughts and behaviors, offering strategies to overcome challenges and improve well-being.

## Usage

AI^3 is designed for seamless command-line interaction, providing users with powerful AI-driven capabilities directly from the Unix shell. Here are some example use cases:

```
$ ai3
You> What is the weather like in Bergen, Norway today?
AI> The current weather in Bergen, Norway is sunny with a high of 29°C.

$ ai3
You> Summarize the key points from the latest health care reform bill.
AI> The latest healthcare reform bill includes several key points: [...]

$ ai3
You> Complete my Ruby On Rails application in myapp/ as a background process for about a week.
AI> Finishing Ruby on Rails app in myapp/...

$ ai3
You> Go through this iPhone and look for keyloggers, rootkits etc.
AI> Starting security analysis on the iPhone...

$ ai3
You> Go to Airbnb.com and find me a decent place to live in downtown NYC. Mail me whenever you find something.
AI> Searching for Airbnb listings in downtown NYC...

$ ai3
You> See my court documents in the `docs/`. Get the Lawyer Assistant to help us win the case.

```

## Installation

AI^3 is easy to install using the provided Zsh installer script. The script automates the setup process, ensuring a smooth and error-free installation.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/ai3.git
   cd ai3
   ```

2. **Run the installer script**:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

3. **Follow the on-screen instructions** to complete the setup.

## Coding Standards

To maintain high-quality code, AI^3 adheres to strict coding standards:

- **String Usage**: Use double quotes for strings.
- **Indentation**: Indent with two spaces instead of four/tabs.
- **Class Naming**: Use underscores for class names instead of dashes.
- **HTML and Rails Tags**: Use Rails tag helpers like `<%= tag.p t("hello_world") %>` instead of standard HTML tags to ensure semantic correctness.
- **CSS Best Practices**: Use flexbox and grid layouts over outdated methods like floats, and sort CSS rules by feature and properties alphabetically.
- **Language Clarity**: Use brief, clear English following Strunk & White’s guidelines to ensure language is easy to understand and avoids unnecessary complexity.

## Final Checks

Before finalizing any updates or releases:

- **Error-free assurance**: Ensure the script and codebase are completely error-free.
- **No repetition**: Immediately correct any detected repetition in code or output.
- **Comprehensive review**: Perform a final, thorough review to confirm all tasks are complete.
- **Iterate as needed**: Repeat checks and refinements until the script is perfect.
